## Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers using an ecommerce store dataset. The dataset comprises 2,019,501 records and 12 columns.

### Project Workflow:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted initial analysis to understand the dataset, visualizing top departments, products, and ordering patterns by time of day and day of the week.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Explored correlations between columns to gain insights into customer behavior.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Utilized the K-means algorithm to segment customers based on departments, products, and other attributes.
- **Data Preparation:** Created a compatible dataset using the crosstab method with user ID and required columns.
- **Determining Cluster Number:** Analyzed inertia to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-means model.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applied PCA reduction to visualize the data in 2 clusters effectively.
